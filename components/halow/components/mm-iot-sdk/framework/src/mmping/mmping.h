/**

 *
 * This is the ICMP echo (ping) request implementation.
 *
 * This implementation is designed to be similar to Unix ping, but differs from it in
 * some respects.
 *
 * The behavior of this ping implementation is as follows:
 *
 * * A ping request will be sent. The time for the next ping request is calculated as the
 *   current time plus the given ping interval.
 * * If the ping response is not received within the ping retry timeout (see below for details)
 *   then it the ping request will be retransmitted. This will be repeated up to
 *   @c MMPING_MAX_RETRIES times.
 * * If @c MMPING_MAX_RETRIES is exceeded or a valid ping reply is received then ping will
 *   wait until the next ping request time calculated above before proceeding to send the
 *   next ping request. If this time has already elapsed then the next ping request will
 *   be sent immediately.
 *
 * The ping retry timeout is calculated as the 2 times average RTT if one or more ping responses
 * have been received, otherwise it will be @c MMPING_INITIAL_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS.
 *
