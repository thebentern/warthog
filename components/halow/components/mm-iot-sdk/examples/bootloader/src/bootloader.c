 * @brief [Deprecated] Example bootloader to boot and update application securely.
 *
 * @deprecated This example application is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
 *             Alternative options include third-party projects, such as MCU Boot, or a platform
 *             specific bootloader, such as @c stm32-mw-mcuboot.
 *
 *
 * Firmware Update Procedure
 * =========================
 * The software update is done in 2 stages.
 *
 * Stage 1: Software download and Authentication
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * This step is performed by the application and is application specific.
 * The application downloads the software image using any means possible and then
 * authenticates it using any means possible - this is all application specific.
 * The update image is in the morse @c MBIN file format. Once the software image has been
 * successfully downloaded and authenticated, the application software needs to signal
 * the bootloader that a new image is available for flashing. it does so by simply writing
 * the path of the software image to config store key UPDATE_IMAGE.  For added security
 * the application also writes a SHA256 hash of the image to IMAGE_SIGNATURE key. Once
 * this is done, the application simply reboots the CPU which causes the bootloader to execute.
 *
 * To build a .mbin file for any application simply issue the following make command in the
 * applications folder:
 * @code
 * make mbin -j4
 * @endcode
 * The result of the above command will be a .mbin file in the `build/` directory for the
 * application in addition to the .elf file.
 * @note You cannot generate a .mbin file for the bootloader itself.
 *
 *
 * Stage 2: Flashing the Software image
 * ------------------------------------
 * This code implements stage 2. Once rebooted by the application, the CPU automatically
 * executes the bootloader (this program) which is in the boot region of flash. The bootloader
 * sees that there is an UPDATE_IMAGE key in config store and proceeds to verify the
 * image pointed to by the key using the SHA256 algorithm and compares the result with
 * the hash in the IMAGE_SIGNATURE key. If the hash matches it then proceeds with
 * flashing the image into the application code area of the flash. In case the checksum
 * does not match the bootloader writes an error code into the config store and jumps back
 * into the old application image without performing the software update. Once the image
 * has been successfully flashed the bootloader transfers control to the new application image.
 *
 * If no UPDATE_IMAGE key was found, the bootloader simply jumps to the current application
 * image in flash.
 *
 * In addition to the above the bootloader performs some sanity checks like checking how many
 * times the update was attempted and failed in order to prevent the bootloader from getting
 * stuck in an infinite update loop in the event of a faulty hardware (or software image).
