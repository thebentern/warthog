 * @file
 * @brief MQTT example to demonstrate connecting to an MQTT broker, subscribing to a topic
 *        and publishing to a topic.
 *
 * @note It is assumed that you have followed the steps in the @ref GETTING_STARTED guide and are
 * therefore familiar with how to build, flash, and monitor an application using the MM-IoT-SDK
 * framework.
 *
 * @ref mqttdemo.c is an example application that demonstrates how to use coreMQTT to connect
 * to an MQTT broker and publish/subscribe to messages.  This example was written based on the
 * tutorial at https://www.freertos.org/mqtt/basic-mqtt-example.html.
 *
 * In this example we attempt to connect to the public MQTT broker at @c test.mosquitto.org
 * on port 1883.  This example connects on the clear, but can be easily converted to use TLS
 * by supplying @c NetworkCredentials_t to @c transport_connect().
 *
 * @note This example is single threaded and so publishes & subscribes in lock step in a
 * single thread. If asynchronous publishes/subscribes are required, then this code will
 * have to be modified to use a message queue and a single thread to handle the MQTT
 * publishes/subscribes. Alternatively you may use the coreMQTT-Agent module which does
 * this for you.
 *
 * # Getting Started
 *
 * ## Using the app only
 *
 * Simply compiling and running the application will show the application connecting to
 * the public MQTT broker and then publishing a message to @c "/MorseMicro/<clientid>/topic"
 * The @c clientid is unique to each device and in this example is based on the MAC address
 * of the device.
 *
 * The device also subscribes to the same topic, so if all is well you should see the
 * message _G'day World_ being displayed on the console.
 *
 * @note This application requires internet connectivity and DNS to connect to the public
 * MQTT broker.  Ensure your access point has DHCP and internet connectivity enabled.
 *
 * ## Verifying the result with a third party MQTT Client
 *
 * You can use a third party MQTT Client such as Mosquitto to independently verify the
 * working of the application.  You may download Mosquitto from
 * @c https://mosquitto.org/download/
 *
 * The above link also includes the Mosquitto MQTT server, which you may use to create
 * a private MQTT broker for your application.
 *
 * Run the mosquitto client using the following command:
 * @code
 * mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -p 1883 -t /MorseMicro/<clientid>/topic
 * @endcode
 * Replace @c "<clientid>" with the client id of your device as displayed on the console.
 *
 * Now run the application.  You should see the message _G'day World!_ appear on the
 * MQTT client which confirms that the application has successfully connected to the
 * MQTT broker and published a message.
 *
 * @note You may use @c mosquitto_pub to publish messages too.  Documentation for
 * @c mosquitto_sub is here: @c https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html. And
 * documentation for mosquitto_pub is here: @c https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html.
 *
 * ## Configuration
 *
 * See @ref APP_COMMON_API for details of WLAN and IP stack configuration. Additional
 * configuration options for this application can be found in the config.hjson file.
 *
 * # Troubleshooting
 *
 * ## Connecting to server socket failed with code 7
 *
 * The most common cause of this issue is AP configuration problems.
 * Check if your device has access to the internet via your HaLow AP.
 *
 * Another possible cause is a tcp socket timeout, which can occur due to issues on
 * the broker side. Try increasing @c MBEDTLS_NET_CLIENT_SOCK_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS to give
 * the socket more time to receive a response.
 *
 * If this error keeps occurring, try setting up a local MQTT broker
 * and changing @ref MQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT to your computer's IP address.
 *
 * ## Creating MQTT connection with broker failed with code 7
 *
 * The main cause of this issue is issues with the Mosquitto test server, which can sometimes
 * fail to respond before @ref MQTT_CONNACK_RECV_TIMEOUT_MS. Try increasing the timeout, or if
 * the problem persists, try setting up a local MQTT broker and changing @ref MQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT
 * to your computer's IP address.
