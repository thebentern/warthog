/**
 * @file
 * @brief Simple DNS client demonstration.
 *
 * @note It is assumed that you have followed the steps in the @ref GETTING_STARTED guide and are
 * therefore familiar with how to build, flash, and monitor an application using the MM-IoT-SDK
 * framework.
 *
 * This file demonstrates how to use DNS to resolve a hostname using the Morse Micro WLAN API.
 *
 * The application sets the primary and secondary DNS servers from the config store keys
 * @c ip.dns_server0 and @c ip.dns_server1, falling back to @c dns.server0 and @c dns.server1
 * if these are not found for legacy support (note that this is done as part of the loading of
 * configuration during app_wlan_init()/app_wlan_start()). It then tries to resolve the IP for
 * the hostname specified in config store key @c dns.lookup -- if the key is not specified then
 * it tries to lookup @c www.google.com. The application has been written in a generic way to
 * display all IP addresses for a given hostname, but currently LwIP returns only 1 IP for
 * each lookup - but this may change in the future.
 *
 * See @ref APP_COMMON_API for details of WLAN and IP stack configuration. Additional
 * configuration options for this application can be found in the config.hjson file.
