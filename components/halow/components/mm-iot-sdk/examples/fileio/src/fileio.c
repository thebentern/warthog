 * @file
 * @brief Example file I/O application using standard C API.
 *
 * @note It is assumed that you have followed the steps in the @ref GETTING_STARTED guide and are
 * therefore familiar with how to build, flash, and monitor an application using the MM-IoT-SDK
 * framework.
 *
 * @ref fileio.c is an example application that demonstrates how to use standard C file I/O
 * routines to access files. We use standard POSIX @c open(), @c close(), @c read() and
 * @c write() function calls to open, close, read and write to files. Other functions
 * supported are @c lseek(), @c mkdir() and @c remove(). Yes, sub-directories are supported.
 * For details on these functions see their definitions in @c sys/unistd.h. If the platform
 * does not support file I/O then calling these functions will return an error.  See
 * @c sys/errno.h for a list of possible error codes that will be returned in @c errno.
 *
 * The file I/O module is automatically included and initialized in the application binary
 * only if @c open() is called from the application. This saves space in applications that
 * do not use this functionality.
